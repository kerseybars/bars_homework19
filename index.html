            <p>
                Hey there, friend! I'm Kersey and a junior UI/UX designer based in Eugene, Oregon (Go Ducks!). 
            </p>
            <img src="images/Profile Image.png">
            <p>
                I began my adult life with the lofty ambition, which I accomplished, of being the first person in my family to graduate from college. I graduated in 2015 with a bachelor's degree from Willamette University with coursework in Exercise and Health Science.
            </p>
            <p>
                After finishing my undergraduate degree, I entered the construction field and worked as a Precision Tune Up Technician for an HVAC company and a Journeyman Painter. So, I'm comfortable with being uncomfortable. For the past 7 years, I have been working as the often the only woman in a group full of men, so I've learned how to effectively communicate with a multitude of people from a variety of backgrounds. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not working, I enjoy training for, and competing in triathlons, reading books, crafting, and spending time with my two cats.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because of my construction background, I excel at problem solving and “seeing how things fit”. I believe that with the advances in technology and society moving towards a more inclusive space, that all people should be able to enjoy browsing websites. I imagine my designs with a "barely there" mentality; I don't want people to have to think when they're using what I've created. As such, I strive to create intuitive, accessible, and fun designs that can be used and appreciated by all.

                        While conducting user research, a common piece of information was that the experience people had while traveling was significantly more important than the destination. As such, I designed an app that would help users find a personalized experince within their travel destination.

                    <p>    
                        This was a 4-week long solo project, where I used Miro, Figma, Invision, and Google Suite to develop a a travel application that allowed my users to cater their experiences based off their budget, number of people, location, and time frame.

                        Named after philosopher, David Hume, the group project aimed to develop an application that was addressed a real-world issue. During ideation, our group decided to create an app that helped our users better understand the relationship between their mood, their habits, and their actions.

                    <p>
                        By incorporating features, such as a daily log, CBT/DBT exercises, and a habit tracker, we empowered our users to be relflective about themselves to allow them more understanding and compassion about themselves.

                        This was a 4-week long group project that focused on redesigning a non-profit website. We picked Bikes for Humanity, because we believe that their website was out of alignment with their mission statement.

                    <p>
                        Their mission statement focuses on making biking accessible, but their website was lacking in accessibility. We reorganized the content, refined the exisiting design, and improved the color contrast to show the intersection of funtionality and aesthetics.
